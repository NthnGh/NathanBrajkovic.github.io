        <h5>Headaches/Migraines</h5>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
	<p>At Lively Chiropractics, our chiropractors recognise that each patient has their own unique issue, therefore our Doctors tailor specific treatment for each individual patient. This attention to detail allows the patient to recover and improve as quickly as possible.
Not every scenario is the same and that is why we take the necessary time to diagnose your specific symptoms before commencing your treatment. 
First weâ€™ll do a consultation and find out if your problem can likely be helped with chiropractic care. There are multiple reasons as to why someone suffers from a condition and we want to make sure that you will be helped with our treatment.
</p>
	<p>To treat migraine headaches, our chiropractors perform spinal adjustments or manipulation to reduce stress and improve spinal function. Treatment also includes soft tissue therapies, which may involve: massage, which includes kneading of joints and muscles.
	  Chiropractic care for migraines has just as much benefits as a massage. Chiropractic care can benefit the CNS by reducing interference to nerve impulses traveling between the brain and body. In order to better treat any problem, it is first vital to understand what causes it.</p>
	<p> There are many different kinds of headaches that can radiate pain all over the head and feel centred in many different places, but it is most important to know that chiropractic care is a great solution to those headaches centred around muscle tension. Sinus headaches may be treated as well but the cause is likely to be more complex. </p>
