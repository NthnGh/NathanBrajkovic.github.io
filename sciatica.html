        <h5>&nbsp;Sciatica</h5>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
	<p>At Lively Chiropractics, our chiropractors recognise that each patient has their own unique issue, therefore our Doctors tailor specific treatment for each individual patient. This attention to detail allows the patient to recover and improve as quickly as possible.
Not every scenario is the same and that is why we take the necessary time to diagnose your specific symptoms before commencing your treatment. 
First we’ll do a consultation and find out if your problem can likely be helped with chiropractic care. There are multiple reasons as to why someone suffers from a condition and we want to make sure that you will be helped with our treatment.
</p>
	<p>Sciatic nerve pain can cause mild to severe pain that comes in from your lower back down through an entire leg. Massive attacks of sciatica might prevent you from even getting out of bed. At our office, our experienced staff can help you combat sciatica, relieving the pressure on the sciatic nerve.
Our chiropractors can apply spinal manipulations to allow a herniated disc to rest back into position and take the pressure off the sciatic nerve. The adjustments can also free limited spinal movement and restore misaligned vertebral discs. You may also have X-rays taken, so our chiropractors can understand what’s causing your pain. For example, an X-ray might show that your spine is narrowed and pinching your sciatic nerve.
Treatment involves stretching and applying controlled pressure to your joints. Our chiropractors could recommend specific exercises for you to do at home to help with your pain.
