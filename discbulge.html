        <h5>&nbsp;Disc Bulge</h5>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
	<p>At Lively Chiropractics, our chiropractors recognise that each patient has their own unique issue, therefore our Doctors tailor specific treatment for each individual patient. This attention to detail allows the patient to recover and improve as quickly as possible.
	  Not every scenario is the same and that is why we take the necessary time to diagnose your specific symptoms before commencing your treatment. 
	  First we’ll do a consultation and find out if your problem can likely be helped with chiropractic care. There are multiple reasons as to why someone suffers from a condition and we want to make sure that you will be helped with our treatment. </p>
	<p>Our chiropractors use gentle spine adjustments to relieve and realign pressure. Light spine adjustments can immediately relieve nerve compression pain from a bulging disc. Depending on your condition, chiropractic care wont reverse the herniation, but it can eliminate your painful symptoms so that surgery, medication and other treatment options become unnecessary. Chiropractic treatment for bulging or herniated discs is safe, effective, and long lasting. If you’re having back pain from a disc problem, you owe it to yourself to seek our quality chiropractic care so that you can enjoy less pain, improved mobility, and better quality of life.</p>
