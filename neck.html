        <h5>&nbsp;Neck pain</h5>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
	<p>At Lively Chiropractics, our chiropractors recognise that each patient has their own unique issue, therefore our Doctors tailor specific treatment for each individual patient. This attention to detail allows the patient to recover and improve as quickly as possible.
	  Not every scenario is the same and that is why we take the necessary time to diagnose your specific symptoms before commencing your treatment. 
	  First weâ€™ll do a consultation and find out if your problem can likely be helped with chiropractic care. There are multiple reasons as to why someone suffers from a condition and we want to make sure that you will be helped with our treatment. </p>
	<p>One of our chiropractors will assess the specific muscles that are tightened up and perform certain muscle releases and soft tissue work to minimize the tension in your neck. A neck adjustment aka cervical manipulation is a precise procedure applied to the joints of the neck, normally by hand. A neck adjustment works to better the mobility of the spine and to restore range of motion; it can also increase movement of the adjoining muscles. Cervical spine manipulations are usually performed when the client is laying on their front and interphalangeal contact is placed over the articulating pillar of the affected joint. The joint is then placed at its end range of motion and all joint play is then locked out. High-velocity, low-amplitude impulse is also applied by using different grip techniques.
	  Chiropractic adjustment is safe when it's performed by one of our trained and licensed staff to deliver chiropractic care. </p>
