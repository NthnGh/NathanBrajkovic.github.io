        <h5>&nbsp;Back pain</h5>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
	<p>At Lively Chiropractics, our chiropractors recognise that each patient has their own unique issue, therefore our Doctors tailor specific treatment for each individual patient. This attention to detail allows the patient to recover and improve as quickly as possible.
Not every scenario is the same and that is why we take the necessary time to diagnose your specific symptoms before commencing your treatment. 
First weâ€™ll do a consultation and find out if your problem can likely be helped with chiropractic care. There are multiple reasons as to why someone suffers from a condition and we want to make sure that you will be helped with our treatment.
</p>
	<p>A chiropractic adjustment is a treatment where one of our chiropractors will apply quick thrusts to the spine to fix alignment, relieve pain, and improve movement. In general, our chiropractors maintain a unique focus on spinal manipulation and treatment of surrounding structures. Many studies have confirmed that manual therapies often used by chiropractors are generally effective for the treatment of lower back pain. </p>
	<p>Some of our treatments are: </p>
	<p>Spinal manipulation and manual manipulation: This type of manual manipulation refers to a high-velocity, short lever arm thrust that is applied to abnormal vertebra with the aim of reducing nerve irritability, improving functionality and restoring range of motion in the back.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Mobilisation: Chiropractic mobilisation refers to low velocity manipulation, movement and stretching of the muscles and joints, with the aim of increasing the range of motion within those areas. </p>
